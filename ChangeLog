2010-03-16  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Release 2.10.

	* dialog.py: add Peter Åstrand's modifications to deal with
	Xdialog's incompatibilities with respect to dialog:
	  - new "use_stdout" keyword argument for Dialog.__init__()
	  - factoring of final newline removals with the addition of
	    Dialog._strip_xdialog_newline().

	* dialog.py: add support for dialog options --no-label,
	--yes-label and --insecure (the last one not being so dangerous as
	the name seems to imply: "Makes the password widget friendlier but
	less secure, by echoing asterisks for each character"; BTW, kdm
	has a very nice way of handling this issue IMO: an option that
	echoes each character with x asterisks, where x = 3 IIRC).

2010-03-14  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Release 2.09.

	* dialog.py: new supported widgets: editbox, inputmenu, mixedform,
	mixedgauge, pause, passwordform, progressbox.

	* demo.py: general improvements, such as:
	    - hopefully more helpful dialog when the user fails to select
	      a file in fselect;
	    - since actually selecting a file with this widget is already
	      boring after the second time, the widget can be exited by
	      pressing Esc or the Cancel button (in which case the parts
	      of the demo that need the file path will be skipped).
	    - replace a few calls to Dialog.scrollbox() by calls to
	      Dialog.msgbox(), since the latter provides nice automatic
	      line wrapping.

	* demo.py: support GNU-style option passing with getopt.py; you
	can use --help to get a list of available options
	* demo.py: no need to change a global variable anymore to switch
	the demo to "fast mode", just use --fast
	* demo.py: add --test-suite mode, mainly for developers: it
	tests *all* widgets, not only those included in the "default
	mode", and automatically enables "fast mode".

	* dialog.py(__call_program): make the function more generic. stdin
	redirection doesn't involve automatic pipe(2) creation in
	__call_program() anymore; instead, __call_program expects a file
	descriptor when it is asked to redirect dialog's stdin (parameter
	'redir_child_stdin_from_fd').

	The caller may still decide to create a pipe and pass its file
	descriptor for reading as the 'redir_child_stdin_from_fd'
	parameter, but the new possibility of redirecting dialog's stdin
	from an arbitrary file descriptor allows for instance to redirect
	it from an existing file, network socket... This is used to
	implement --progressbox cleanly.

	This change has the additional benefit of simplifying the API,
	since __call_program()'s return value is always a 2-element tuple
	now.

	* dialog.py(__call_program): new close_fds option causing the
	child process to close the specified file descriptors before the
	execve(2) system call. This is useful for instance to have the
	child close an end of a pipe he isn't going to use. Without that,
	deadlocks could happen because of the child never seeing EOF from
	the pipe.

	* dialog.py: use warnings.warn(..., DeprecationWarning) for
	obsolete functions.

	* dialog.py: remove convoluted syntax *(<list>,) that was used at
	several places. I don't see any use for this syntax anymore, and
	changing it to simply <list> didn't make the universe collapse (so
	far).

	* dialog.py: prefix attributes for internal use (such as
	Dialog._call_program) with a single underscore instead of a double
	one: we don't need the name mangling here. These underscores in
	dialog.py are just an indication that the attribute is "internal"
	and thus subject to API changes, etc. Thanks to Peter Åstrand for
	pointing this out.

	* setup.py:
	  - improve the long description, use ReStructuredText
	  - add Trove classifiers
	  - add download_url

	* Review and update README, TODO...

2010-02-19  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: add support for --dselect
	* dialog.py: add support for DIALOG_ITEM_HELP
	* demo.py: small fixes

2009-10-31  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.08, skipping version 2.07 to avoid creating confusion
	with the 2.7 version released by Peter Åstrand in 2004.

2009-02-04  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Add support for --form.

	* dialog.py(__call_program): compute the argument list before
	forking, otherwise things get difficult to understand if this
	computation raises an exception.

2004-03-29  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.06.

2004-03-19  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: fixed a bug with the default_item "common argument"
	(corresponding to dialog's --default-item option) thanks to Peter
	Mathiasson.

2004-03-16  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* demo.py: make sure the directory passed to --fselect ends with
	os.sep so that its contents can be seen right away in the file
	selection box displayed by dialog.

2004-03-15  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: fix a bug (the standard output of the process running
	dialog used to be connected to a pipe) that rendered pythondialog
	unusable with recent versions of dialog (thanks, Peter Åstrand!).

	* dialog.py: the generic exception is now 'error' ('dialog.error',
	if you understand this better). The old name is still there for
	backward-compatibility.
	* Several new exceptions have appeared: PythonDialogSystemError,
	PythonDialogIOError, PythonDialogOSError,
	PythonDialogErrorBeforeExecInChildProcess,
	PythonDialogReModuleError, UnableToCreateTemporaryDirectory,
	PythonDialogBug, ProbablyPythonBug.
	* dialog.py: the ExecutableNotFound exception was not mentioned in
	the docstring module. Fixed.
	* dialog.py: the complete_message() of 'error' instances does not
	write a dot at the end of the message anymore.
	* dialog.py: rename the ExceptionPrettyIdentifier attribute of
	'error' subclasses to ExceptionShortDescription.
	* dialog.py: the constructor of 'error' instances can now be
	called with no argument if no useful message can be added to the
	ExceptionShortDescription.

	* dialog.py: added the new DIALOG_EXTRA and DIALOG_HELP return
	codes that appeared somewhere between versions 0.9a-20020309a and
	0.9b-20040301 of dialog.

	* dialog.py: Remove the possibility to choose (from Dialog's
	constructor) the values of the DIALOG_{OK,CANCEL,ERROR,...}
	environment variables passed to dialog because this is absolutely
	useless as far as I can see and clutters the API.

	* dialog.py: Dialog's constructor has a new 'compat' parameter
	that can be used to enable a compatibility mode with dialog-like
	programs whose interface is only slightly different from that of
	dialog. The demo runs fine with Xdialog 2.0.6 in the "Xdialog"
	compatibility mode. However, I don't want the special cases to
	expand too much, so it would be really better for you to report
	bugs if your dialog-like program is not dialog-compatible!

	* dialog.py: don't try any PATH components (nor any components
	from ":/bin:/usr/bin" if PATH is undefined) if the 'dialog'
	parameter of Dialog's constructor contains a '/'.

	* dialog.py: somewhere between versions 0.9a-20020309a and
	0.9b-20040301, dialog started not to quote tags in the output of
	--checklist if they didn't contain any space. Adapt the dialog
	invocation (now using --separate-output) and the output parsing
	accordingly (still works with 0.9a-20020309a).

	* dialog.py: the data fed to dialog in Dialog.gauge_update()
	happened to work with dialog 0.9a-20020309a but did not conform to
	the manual page and presumably broke Xdialog. This is fixed,
	thanks to Peter Åstrand.

	* dialog.py: modifications in Dialog.scrollbox():
	    - don't use the old insecure tempfile.mktemp() anymore
	      (tempfile.mkstemp() didn't exist before Python 2.3)
	    - don't display a title for the box if no title was in kwargs
	    - the return value is now that of the dialog-like program
	    - UnableToCreateTemporaryDirectory is now raised if for some
	      strange reason, we cannot create a temporary directory

	* dialog.py: review every function to catch possible exceptions
	such as IOError and OSError, in order to turn them into subclasses
	of 'error' (such as PythonDialogIOError and PythonDialogOSError).
	Rare beasts such as MemoryError are still not caught. Such an
	enterprise would be unreasonable, if not simply impossible.
	* dialog.py: updated the various docstrings to show which
	exceptions every function can raise. To make this manageable, many
	functions refer to the docstrings of internal, heavily-used
	functions such as Dialog.__perform whose docstrings are,
	unfortunately but rightfully, not included in the HTML
	documentation generated by pydoc. Some sort of automated
	documentation generation system would be needed to solve this
	problem in a satisfactory way.

	* demo.py: minor update with respect to Debian sarge's release
	date forecasts...

2003-09-16  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.05.

	* Changed the "private" class names to start with two underscores
	instead of one.

2003-09-01  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.04.

	* dialog.py: Replaced the apply() calls with calls using the
	"extended call syntax" since apply() is deprecated since the
	release of Python 2.3.

2002-09-05  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Released 2.03.

	* dialog.py: Reorganized the documentation between the module's
	docstring and that of the Dialog class.

	* README: Added the "history" section and other improvements.

2002-09-04  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Prefixed global variables with an underscore and
	made some cosmetic fixes.

	* dialog.py: Removed the set_background_title alias to
	setBackgroundTitle since nobody uses it yet and setBackgroundTitle
	is obsolete. Even though I prefer set_background_title to
	setBackgroundTitle for consistency with other methods, there is no
	point in adding an obsolete method.

2002-09-03  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* Packaged pythondialog with Distutils.

	* Improved the README.

2002-09-02  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Improved the common_args_syntax initialization so
	that simple dialog Common Options can be passed as foo=1 keyword
	arguments with 1 having a real boolean meaning (was not the case
	before).

	* Handled the licensing stuff : GNU LGPL license for dialog.py and
	public domain for demo.py. Added the COPYING file.

	* dialog.py: Wrote a proper module docstring.

	* demo.py: Added the last widgets to the demo.

2002-08-30  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Added the calendar, fselect, passwordbox, tailbox and
	timebox widgets.

2002-08-29  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py (_wait_for_program_termination): Raises a DialogError
	exception when dialog returns self.DIALOG_ERROR. Exceptions are so
	handy.

	* demo.py: Cleaned up the demo code making it easier (I hope) to
	focus on a given widget, added error handling.
	* dialog.py: Took the demo to put it in a new, separate file:
	demo.py.


2002-08-21  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Documented the widgets properly.
	* dialog.py: Generalized the widgets that didn't offer all the
	capabilities available from dialog.
	* dialog.py: Went through the various widgets so that the
	associated methods return the dialog exit status (with additional
	information, if relevant).

	* dialog.py: Finally cleaned up the method used to collect the
	arguments given to dialog. They are now stored as elements of a
	list and properly quoted to protect them from shell expansion just
	before the call to popen3. Now, you should be safe with any
	character in the strings passed to dialog (labels, texts, etc.).

2002-08-09  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: All boxes should now support the common arguments
	scheme (well, I still have to look at the gauge closer).

	* dialog.py: Added support for "common arguments"; now, you can
	use any combination of the _common options_ for the dialog program
	when creating a box. Example:

	   d.checklist(<usual args for a checklist box>,
	               title="...", backtitle="...", <other common args>)

	One thing is still broken: we must shell-escape the strings so
	that apostrophes (') used to delimit shell arguments don't clash
	with apostrophes used these arguments themselves.

	* dialog.py: Added support for "persistent arguments" arguments
	(--backtitle is a good candidate for this).

	* dialog.py: Removed a leftover debugging print in _perform.

	* dialog.py: Simplified the DIALOG* arguments handling.

2002-08-08  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Added a short docstring for the module.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote checklist to get all the features from the
	corresponding option in dialog.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote _perform; now, we can use the DIALOG*
	environment variables set in the constructor, which allows us
	distinguish between ESC pressed and a dialog error, among others;
	also, we use no temporary file anymore to store dialog's stderr.

	* dialog.py: Added some exceptions.

	* dialog.py: Rewrote __init__; now, we can set choose in the
	constructor the DIALOG* environment variables to pass the dialog
	program as well as this program (could be whiptail for instance)
	from the constructor (and the environment variables can be
	different for two Dialog instances used in the same python
	process...).

	* dialog.py: Renamed __foo methods to _foo.

2002-08-07  Florent Rougon  <flo@via.ecp.fr>

	* dialog.py: Cosmetic fixes.

	* dialog.py: Added a proper GPL header (dialog.py only had a short
	mention about its license being the GNU GPL).

	* Split dialog.py, creating a Changelog file in the format
	described in the GNU Coding Standards, as well as README, AUTHORS,
	COPYING and TODO.

2000-07-30  Sultanbek Tezadov (http://sultan.da.ru/)

	* dialog.py: Added the gauge widget.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'title' option to some widgets.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'checked' option to the checklist dialog;
	clicking "Cancel" is now recognizable.

	* dialog.py: Added a 'selected' option to the radiolist dialog;
	clicking "Cancel" is now recognizable.

	* dialog.py: Some other cosmetic changes and improvements.

2000-??-??  Robb Shecter <robb@acm.org>

	* Initial release.
