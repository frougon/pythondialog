.. module:: dialog
   :synopsis: A Python interface to the UNIX dialog utility and mostly-compatible programs
   :platform: Unix

This manual documents pythondialog_, a Python wrapper for the dialog_
utility originally written by Savio Lam, and later rewritten by Thomas
E. Dickey. Its purpose is to provide an easy to use, pythonic and
comprehensive Python interface to :program:`dialog`. This allows one to make
simple text-mode user interfaces on Unix-like systems.

pythondialog's functionality is contained within the :mod:`dialog` Python
module. This module doesn't contain much Unix-specific code, if
any; however, its backend of reference, which is the :program:`dialog`
program, only works on Unix-like platforms so far as I can tell. Given a
suitable backend, the :mod:`dialog` module could work on other platforms.
