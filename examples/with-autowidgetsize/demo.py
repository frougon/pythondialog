"""Demonstration program for pythondialog.

This is a program demonstrating most of the possibilities offered by
the pythondialog module (which is itself a Python interface to the
well-known dialog utility, or any other program compatible with
dialog).

Executive summary
-----------------

If you are looking for a very simple example of pythondialog usage,
short and straightforward, please refer to simple_example.py. The
file you are now reading serves more as a demonstration of what can
be done with pythondialog and as a cheap test suite than as a first
time tutorial. However, it can also be used to learn how to invoke
the various widgets. The following paragraphs explain what you should
keep in mind if you read it for this purpose.


Most of the code in the MyApp class (which defines the actual
contents of the demo) relies on a class called MyDialog implemented
here that:

  1. wraps all widget-producing calls in a way that automatically
     spawns a "confirm quit" dialog box if the user presses the
     Escape key or chooses the Cancel button, and then redisplays the
     original widget if the user doesn't actually want to quit;

  2. provides a few additional dialog-related methods and convenience
     wrappers.

The handling in (1) is completely automatic, implemented with
MyDialog.__getattr__() returning decorated versions of the
widget-producing methods of dialog.Dialog. Therefore, most of the
demo can be read as if the module-level 'd' attribute were a
dialog.Dialog instance whereas it is actually a MyDialog instance.
The only meaningful difference is that MyDialog.<widget>() will never
return a CANCEL or ESC code (attributes of 'd', or more generally of
dialog.Dialog). The reason is that these return codes are
automatically handled by the MyDialog.__getattr__() machinery to
display the "confirm quit" dialog box.

In some cases (e.g., fselect_demo()), I wanted the "Cancel" button to
perform a specific action instead of spawning the "confirm quit"
dialog box. To achieve this, the widget is invoked using
dialog.Dialog.<widget> instead of MyDialog.<widget>, and the return
code is handled in a semi-manual way. A prominent feature that needs
such special-casing is the yesno widget, because the "No" button
corresponds to the CANCEL exit code, which in general must not be
interpreted as an attempt to quit the program!

To sum it up, you can read most of the code in the MyApp class (which
defines the actual contents of the demo) as if 'd' were a
dialog.Dialog instance. Just keep in mind that there is a little
magic behind the scenes that automatically handles the CANCEL and ESC
Dialog exit codes, which wouldn't be the case if 'd' were a
dialog.Dialog instance. For a first introduction to pythondialog with
simple stuff and absolutely no magic, please have a look at
simple_example.py.

A NEW HOPE

It was a period of intense
sucking. Graphical toolkits for
Python were all nice and clean,
but they were, well, graphical.
And as every one knows, REAL
PROGRAMMERS ALWAYS WORK ON VT-100
TERMINALS. In text mode.

Besides, those graphical toolkits
were usually too complex for
simple programs, so most FLOSS
geeks ended up writing
command-line tools except when
they really needed the full power
of mainstream graphical toolkits,
such as Qt, GTK+ and wxWidgets.

But... thanks to people like
Thomas E. Dickey, there are now
at our disposal several free
software command-line programs,
such as dialog, that allow easy
building of graphically-oriented
interfaces in text-mode
terminals. These are good for
tasks where line-oriented
interfaces are not well suited,
as well as for the increasingly
common type who runs away as soon
as he sees something remotely
resembling a command line.

But this is not for Python! I want
my poney!

Seeing this unacceptable
situation, Robb Shecter had the
idea, back in the olden days of
Y2K (when the world was supposed
to suddenly collapse, remember?),
to wrap a dialog interface into a
Python module called dialog.py.

pythondialog was born. Florent
Rougon, who was looking for
something like that in 2002,
found the idea rather cool and
improved the module during the
following years...""" + 15*'\n'
